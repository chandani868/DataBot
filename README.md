# CSV-Data-Query-App

## Overview
The Smart Data Query App is a Streamlit-based web application that allows users to upload one or two CSV files and perform intelligent queries on the uploaded data using natural language processing (NLP). The app leverages powerful language models from Google Palm and Langchain, PandasAI to facilitate conversational data querying and provides detailed responses based on the data content.

Features
1. Upload CSV Files: Users can upload one or two CSV files to analyze.
2. Data Preview: The app provides a preview of the uploaded CSV files.
3. Natural Language Queries: Users can input queries in natural language to extract insights from the data.
4. Intelligent Responses: The app uses advanced language models to process queries and return relevant responses.
5. Query History: Users can view the history of their queries and responses.

## ðŸ”§ Work Ahead:

1. Sometimes, it takes several prompting techniques to achieve the desired results. In this project, I've combined two toolsâ€”PandasAI and Langchain's Pandas DataFrame agentâ€”to ensure that if one fails to produce an output, the other will succeed. I plan to integrate even more robust tools to enhance and streamline the workflow.

2. Can Integrate additional language models to provide more robust and diverse query handling capabilities.
